# TODO

- Serializable objects ( probably use node serialize-javascript and deno crypto.randombytes )
- cxctrl 
    - Integrate the bootstrap function into Ctrl: DONE
    - Move the actionFactory to cxctrl - DONE
    - Ensure the correct execution order between @action, constructor() and botstrap() and actionFactory
    - Make it clear that Main can only return success or failure (and test that it does)
    - Implement Swarm 
      - Execution graph, add configuration
      - Publish event with arguments (which specific swarm object published?)
      - Collect method
    - Threshold conflict resolution
- Action 
    - The update function should be aware of state typeof Array - SKIPPED, Typescript thinks that Arrays should be immutable
    - Test the Array functionality SKIPPED , se just above
    - The main() should be restricted to allways returning true or false
    - test getCollection()
    - test run()
    - fix and re-include the update function
- Store
    - Remove jobId references from Store: OK
    - remove index prefix default - NO
    - check if index exists before creating - OK
    - test functionality of other indexes than the job-index
    - Find some hash-freindly, but sortable, id type for jobIds - TBD
    - Also, test the creation of some other indexcies 
- Implement the job depth based thresshold cleanup for:
    - Jobs and Store objects
    - Indexes
    - Interdependencies and conflict resolution for multiple jobs and indecies
    - Swarms
    - Read consistency when deleting
- cxmeta, es6 data types:
    - check/test all type found in: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects
    - Use the reflect-metadata package for the metadata
    - This could be a stand-alone package, that is generic javascript function for both Node and Deno
